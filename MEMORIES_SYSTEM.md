## Integration with Muninn Voice Assistant

The voice assistant integration adds intelligent memory recall through the command processor.

### Adding Voice Commands

To enable voice recall, update the command processor to handle memory-related intents:

**Example intents:**
- `play_joke` - Play a random joke memory
- `play_story` - Play a story memory
- `play_memory_from` - Play memory from specific person
- `tell_about` - Play memories matching topic/tags

The backend already supports:
- `GET /api/memories/random?memory_type=joke&person=Jean`
- Filtering by any combination of person, type, length, tags

## File Organization

Memory audio files are stored in:
```
/home/bw/muninn/muninn-v3/recordings/
```

With naming pattern:
```
memory_{person}_{type}_{timestamp}.wav
```

Example:
```
memory_Jean_joke_20251022_153045.wav
```

## Deployment

The memories system is automatically included when you deploy the web portal.

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# Transfer updated files
rsync -avz --delete muninn-modular/ bw@raspberrypi:/home/bw/muninn/muninn-v3/muninn-modular/

# Restart web portal
ssh bw@raspberrypi
sudo systemctl restart muninn-web-portal.service
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status muninn-web-portal.service

# Test memories page
curl http://localhost:5001/memories
```

## Database Migration

When you first restart the web portal after deploying this update, the memories table will be created automatically. Existing messages are not affected.

To verify the table was created:
```bash
sqlite3 /home/bw/muninn/muninn-v3/messages.db "SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE name='memories';"
```

## UI Design

The memories interface matches the existing retro gaming aesthetic:
- **Press Start 2P font** for authentic retro feel
- **Dark background** with colored gradients
- **Large, accessible buttons** for easy selection
- **Step-by-step wizard** for guided experience
- **Mobile responsive** for recording on phones

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] Photo/video attachments with memories
- [ ] Memory collections (group related memories)
- [ ] Date context (when did this happen?)
- [ ] Related memories linking
- [ ] Privacy levels (some memories just for Dad)
