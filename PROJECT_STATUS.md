**Solutions Implemented:**
- Enhanced systemd service files with:
  - Restart limits (max 5 attempts in 10 minutes)
  - Memory limits (512MB assistant, 256MB web portal)
  - CPU limits (80% assistant, 50% web portal)
  - Graceful shutdown handling

**Files Created:**
- `health_check.sh` - System health monitoring
- `system_monitor.py` - Continuous monitoring service
- `muninn-monitor.service` - Optional monitoring service
- `deploy_services.sh` - Automated deployment
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full documentation
- `RELIABILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Technical details

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Resolved ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Service restart loops - Fixed with restart limits
- ‚úÖ Resource exhaustion - Fixed with memory/CPU limits
- ‚úÖ Python path errors - Documented in deployment guide
- ‚úÖ Line ending issues - Fixed with dos2unix

### To Monitor
- Memory usage under load
- CPU temperature during recording
- Disk space (audio files accumulate)
- Service stability over time

### Deployment Notes
- Always use `rsync` for file transfer
- Always run `dos2unix` on scripts after transfer
- Always check health after deployment
- Test recordings from both mobile and desktop

## Testing Checklist

### Before Next Deployment
- [ ] Backup current database
- [ ] Test local recording on development machine
- [ ] Verify all family names are correct
- [ ] Review memory type categories

### After Deployment
- [ ] Web portal loads
- [ ] Memories button visible
- [ ] Memories page loads
- [ ] Can select person/type/length
- [ ] Can record audio
- [ ] Memory saves successfully
- [ ] Can browse memories
- [ ] Can filter/search
- [ ] Can play memories
- [ ] Can delete memories
- [ ] Messages system still works
- [ ] No errors in logs

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Kept Messages Separate** - Memories are a new system, messages untouched
2. **Guided UI** - Wizard approach vs freeform entry
3. **Large Buttons** - Accessibility for all ages
4. **Retro Aesthetic** - Maintained existing gaming theme
5. **Browser Recording** - No app needed, works on any device
6. **Rich Metadata** - Enables smart filtering and recall
7. **Optional Voice Recall** - Can add later without breaking existing system
